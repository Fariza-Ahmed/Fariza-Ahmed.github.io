        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <p>I designed a scene that depicts an entryway to a room with a kitchen. Towards the
            viewer’s right, there is a kitchen with two counters each with cabinets above. The
            counters and cabinets have a wooden texture and the countertops have a marble texture.
            There is also a sink included in the kitchen. The highlight of the kitchen is the tiles which
            are placed between the bottom counters and top cabinets. The tiles were created using
            separate square, flat surfaces with the texture that is seen. The counters and cabinets were
            created using cylinders and separate flat surfaces. Cylinders were also used for the sink
            and again a flat surface for the texture of the inside of the sink. Straight ahead in the
            viewers direction is a door texture.</p>
            
            <p>To the left of the viewpoint is a table with two stool
            chairs. Both the table and chairs were created with cylinders. The tops of the chairs have
            a straw texture. The wall directly behind the table and chairs has an artsy texture and the
            wall to the left of the table and chairs has a texture of a screen door with blinds showing a
            mock view of the scene outside the room. The entire floor of the room is a light wood
            texture. There are three light sources in the scene. One placed more towards the viewer’s
            right which is intended to be some sort of light source in the apartment. The other two are
            placed to the viewer’s left and are intended to mock light coming into the room from
            outside. One light represents day and the other represents night. All of the colors,
            textures, and lights were chosen to compliment the theme of the scene.</p>
